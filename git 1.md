#what if there was no version control system
=>if there was no version control system the we have to copy/paste the codes or use google google drives for code sharing

# Advantage of using VCS (Version Control System)
=>Track the entry of your entire code base
=> It helps to collabrate in a team
=> Maintain the code version

# Version Comtrol System => Git, Google, mercurial vos

# We should also keep our code somewhere in the cloud. It would be if the cloud supports git
# Thats why we use Github

-git config--global user.name
-git config --global email:legned111@gmail.com
